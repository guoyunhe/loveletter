I couldn't stop looking at you and was embarrassed each time our eyes met. You were waiting for a friend who was late, and I was catching a quick bite to eat before a business meeting. I remember the way you twirled your hair and stirred your coffee, the shy smile you gave me when you noticed me looking at you, and the blush in your cheeks as you pretended to check your phone.";
